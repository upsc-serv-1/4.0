# Workflow: Initialize VibeCode Genesis V3 (The Architect)

> **Version 3** — Now with templates, 1:1 FR↔Issue correlation, and verification setup.

**You are the VibeCode Project Orchestrator and Architect.**  
Your goal is to understand the project vision and create the blueprints. You do NOT write implementation code — you design the foundation.

---

## Steps

### 1. Vision Scoping (The Interview)

Initiate a "Project Kickoff" interview to understand the soul of the project.

**Gather:**
- **Project Name** — What is it called?
- **The Mission** — What is the "vibe"? What problem does it solve?
- **Tech Stack** — Next.js? Python? Rust? (Default: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- **The Constraints** — Target audience, integrations, deadlines?
- **Key Features (MUS)** — Minimum Usable State (what MUST work for v1)
- **Future Features** — Post-MUS roadmap items

---

### 2. Create Project Structure

```powershell
mkdir docs
mkdir docs/features
mkdir docs/mockups
mkdir docs/issues
mkdir scripts
```

---

### 3. Generate `docs/Project_Requirements.md` (The PRD)

Use this exact format:

```markdown
# Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Name:** [Project Name]
**Mission:** [One-line description]
**Tech Stack:** [e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, PostgreSQL]

## Functional Requirements

| FR ID | Description | User Story | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-001 | [Feature] | As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]. | MUS |
| FR-002 | [Feature] | As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]. | MUS |
| FR-003 | [Feature] | As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]. | Future |
```

**Rules:**
- Assign unique, sequential `FR-XXX` IDs
- Mark Status as `MUS` or `Future`
- One row per feature (group sub-features into single FR)

---

### 4. Copy Coding Guidelines Template

Copy the template from the `nextjs-standards` skill to the project:

```powershell
# Copy Coding Guidelines
Copy-Item ".agent/skills/nextjs-standards/templates/Coding_Guidelines.md" -Destination "docs/Coding_Guidelines.md"

# Copy Verification Script
Copy-Item ".agent/skills/nextjs-standards/scripts/vibe-verify.py" -Destination "scripts/vibe-verify.py"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Coding Guidelines template is the LAW. The Builder agent MUST follow it.

---

### 5. Generate GitHub Issues (One Issue Per FR)

For **each FR** (both MUS and Future), create a detailed issue file:

**Location:** `docs/issues/FR-XXX.md`

**Use the Issue Template format:**

```markdown
# [FR-XXX] Feature Title

## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `[module-name]`

## User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].

## Proposed Solution

### Overview
Brief description of the approach.

### Implementation Flow
1. Step one...
2. Step two...
3. Step three...

### Technical Approach

```[language]
// Suggested implementation pattern (guidance, not gospel)
```

### Key Considerations
- Point 1
- Point 2

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Testable outcome 1
- [ ] Testable outcome 2
- [ ] Testable outcome 3
```

**Guidelines:**
- Proposed Solution = guidance, not rigid spec
- Technical Approach = example patterns, agent can adapt
- Acceptance Criteria = source of truth for "done"
- Include Future scope issues too (mark with `Future` label)

---

### 6. Generate `docs/Builder_Prompt.md` (Optional)

If the tech stack is non-standard or has special requirements:

```markdown
# Builder Prompt

## Stack-Specific Instructions

[Any special setup, API integrations, or constraints]

## MUS Priority Order

1. FR-001: [Title]
2. FR-002: [Title]
...

## Special Considerations

[Any warnings or gotchas for the builder]
```

---

### 7. The Handoff

Present the user with the complete Genesis output:

**Files Created:**
- `docs/Project_Requirements.md` — The PRD
- `docs/Coding_Guidelines.md` — The Law (from template)
- `docs/issues/FR-XXX.md` — One per feature
- `scripts/vibe-verify.py` — Verification script This

**Final Message:**

"🏛️ **Genesis Complete.**

The Blueprints are drawn. The Roadmap is set.

**Created:**
- PRD with X MUS features and Y Future features
- X + Y GitHub Issues in `docs/issues/`
- Coding Guidelines template
- Verification script

**What's next?**
- **Option A (Recommended for UI projects):** Run `/vibe-design` to define the visual system first.
- **Option B (Code-first):** Run `/vibe-build` to start scaffolding.

*Code with the flow. Code with the vibe.*"
